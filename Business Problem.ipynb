    "As people are migrating to Canada they need a lot of research for a good housing price. This project can help those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, Cafe, School, mall, theatre, hospital, etc. This Project creates an analysis of features for a people migrating to Scarborough to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, and good management for emergency.\n",

    "The major purpose of this project is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the people who are shiffting there. Social presence in society in terms of like minded people.

As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. Although immigration has become a hot topic over the past few years with more governments seeking more restrictions on immigrants and refugees, the general trend of immigration into Canada has been one of on the rise.\n",

To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",
